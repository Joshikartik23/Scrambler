# Scrambler
Scrambler is a comprehensive client-side encryption and hashing application built entirely using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, CryptoJS, and the Web Crypto API. The project is designed to provide users with a secure and intuitive way to encrypt, decrypt, and hash both text and files directly within their browser, without the need for any backend server. This ensures complete privacy, as no data ever leaves the user's device. The application supports multiple encryption algorithms including AES (implemented with PBKDF2 key strengthening), DES, TripleDES, and Base64 encoding. It also includes hashing capabilities using SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA-1, and MD5 algorithms for verification and integrity checks.

The user interface is built to be modern and responsive, offering features such as drag-and-drop file uploads, a dark mode toggle, real-time toast notifications, and clear visual feedback throughout the encryption processes. Text encryption and decryption are designed to be straightforward, while file encryption is implemented in a binary-safe manner using ArrayBuffer, Blob, and FileReader APIs, ensuring support for images, documents, and other binary formats. A built-in random key generator powered by the Web Crypto API helps users create secure and unpredictable keys instantly.

The project follows a well-organized, modular JavaScript architecture that separates core logic into dedicated components such as UI handlers, utility functions, AES encryption engines, and file processors. This structure improves maintainability, readability, and scalability, making the codebase easy to update or extend with new features or algorithms in the future. The Visual design focuses on clarity and usability, enabling both technical and non-technical users to interact with the tool effectively.

Scrambler was developed to deepen practical understanding of modern cryptography techniques, browser-level security, asynchronous file processing, and clean front-end engineering practices. It serves as both a functional security tool and a learning project that demonstrates strong capabilities in JavaScript development, file handling, UI design, and client-side encryption workflows.
